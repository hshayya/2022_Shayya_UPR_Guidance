**Notes**

1) For genomics and flow cytometry folders, see corresponding folders in Mendeley dataset for useful intermediate & output files. The posted code contains commented-out lines that read the intermediate files and generate the final figures in the paper, which will save some time on re-doing the anlaysis. 
2) Please note that some aspects of the genomics (ie. alignment) introduce randomness that will cause the included intermediate files to differ (VERY) slightly from the files you might get re-running the analysis from scratch. This is expected and will not affect the conclusions of the work.
3) Image processing scripts are generally meant to serve as examples to show how the analysis was done, not re-create the entire analysis. The size of the dataset and complexity of the file-structure here make it so that most scripts provided will not work "out-of-the-box". 
4) Imaging data can be found in two places on Mendeley: Images_20xGlomeruli.zip (max projections of all M71/M28 Perk/Ddit3/Hsp 20x glomeruli, blinded annotations, montages) and imageproc_gloms_pearson.zip (pxintz intermediate files for Pearson correlations of red/green fibers in M28 Ddit3/Perk glomeruli) 
5) Please note that in much of the code we label our genotypes as WT (=WT), Ctrl (=Het) and Exp (=cKO). This shows up in filenames/variable names, especially in the imaging analysis. On final figures, these labels are updated to the WT/Het/cKO nomenclature used in the paper.
6) Please contact Hani if you'd like anything that isn't posted and we'll figure out a way to get it to you.
